00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,180
There are a lot of claims to fact check. Jason Puckett verifies

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,140
vice president mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris took to the debate stage

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,120
Wednesday for the first and only vice presidential debate of this election.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,890
Now right now we're breaking down one claim from each.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,610
Here's Kamala Harris, do you know this administration

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,110
took the word science off the website

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,240
and then took the phrase climate change off the website.

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,820
This claim is true but needs context.

9
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,860
A study by the Environmental data and governance initiative tracked

10
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,260
government websites and found many agencies like the E.

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,190
P. A. Removed and changed parts of their websites during the trump admin.

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,370
These changes included the removal and quote

13
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,100
overhaul of climate change sections of sites including

14
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:44,670
the E P a

15
00:00:44,885 --> 00:00:48,315
White house dot gov, Department of State and the Department of Energy.

16
00:00:48,485 --> 00:00:51,455
Now it's true that mentions of climate change were removed from those sites,

17
00:00:51,555 --> 00:00:54,745
but not all government websites have had the words removed

18
00:00:54,845 --> 00:00:57,005
climate dot gov and clean net dot org.

19
00:00:57,005 --> 00:00:58,885
Both government sites that have collections about

20
00:00:58,885 --> 00:01:00,785
climate change still on their websites.

21
00:01:00,785 --> 00:01:02,455
Right now, here's mike Pence.

22
00:01:02,925 --> 00:01:05,364
When joe biden was vice president of the United States,

23
00:01:05,905 --> 00:01:09,355
not 7.5 million people contracted the swine flu.

24
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,390
60 million americans contracted the swine flu.

25
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,590
This claim is true but needs context.

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,810
The CDC estimates for swine flu do show between

27
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,990
40 to 90 million estimated cases in the U.

28
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,400
S. Between 2009 and 2010.

29
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:26,690
So far, we have roughly 7.5 million confirmed Covid cases in the US,

30
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,910
it is important to point out that this is not the same

31
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,130
time period since Covid has not been around for a year yet.

32
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:32,810
Alright, so.
